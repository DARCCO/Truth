##The Anonymous Poll App Where Users Tell You the Truth!##

Have you ever wondered what people think of your new shirt? Have you ever been undecided on what to eat for lunch? Have you ever needed a little extra nudge to buy that multi-thousand dollar electric guitar? Truth gives you the opportunity to create a poll, with a photo, to receive the feedback you've always wanted. The anonymous nature of this app allows you to get quick, honest, and downright hilarious responses to whatever questions are on your mind.

##How to Get Started##

Each guest has the option to either login, or sign up. If you haven't created a user name yet, click the right tab on the navigation bar at the top of the page. You will be prompted to write an unique username as well as a verifiable password. Once you have logged in, you will see a dashboard with all the pending polls of anonymous users. Read each one and submit an honest answer!

###Create Your Own Polls###

Now you have the opportunity to learn what people actually think! Create your own custom poll by clicking "Create Poll" on the navigation bar. Submit a photo, which will automatically be formatted for the website, and create no less than 2 custom answers. You're limited to 4 answers total. After you're satisfied with your anonymous poll, click the submit button. Keep it classy, but have fun!

###The Truth in Real Time!###

Thanks to cutting edge web development technology, users are able to see the results of their polls in instant time. Click the "Results Polls" tab to see what users think.

##For Developers##

We highly incourage developers to contribute to our open source app! We can certainly benefit from your input and feedback both technically and with your ideas for improvement. We used `React` and `Redux` for the front end, `Webpack` as our build tool, `Node.js` and `Express` for our server, and `MongoDB` for the database.

###Github Repository###

Visit our Github repo at `https://github.com/DARCCO/Truth`. Fork the repo and clone it down to your local computer. You will need to run `npm install` as well as `webpack` to start up your local server. Consult the React documentation at `https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html`. Tools like `Robomongo` and `Postman` will be beneficial for anyone planning on submitting pull requests to our master repo. Also, be sure to provide your own `config.js` file in the `server` folder which should provide a string, as a secret, of any numeric and/or alphabetic key. Provide this in the following form:

    // hold application secrets and config

    module.exports = {
      secret: 'enter secret here'
    };
